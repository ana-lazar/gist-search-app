# Gist Search App

The project was created using Create React App.
Please use the npm install script, followed by npm start.

## Details

Use the API provided by Github Gist API, to create a basic single-page application with any Web framework. The goal of this application is to allow its users to enter a username and get the full list of public Gists for that user.

Here's the list of full functionality required for the assignment: 
- Search: When a user enters a username, they should be able to get a full list of public Gists by that user. 
- Filetypes: Convert the filetypes of the files in the Gist into a tag/badge (For example, if the returned Gist has a list of files containing Python and Javascript files, the items listed should have the respective tags/badges). 
- Forks: Additionally, include with the list of the Gists, the username/avatar of the last 3 users who have forked it. 
- Gist contents: When clicking one of the Gists, display the content of the file
